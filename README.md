# Feature

- jquery mobile
- Ajax

# development memo

Ajax assumes communication between the same domain, so if you check it on the browser, it seems that there is a workaround by inserting a chrome plug-in that causes an error due to cross domain,<br>
Once the operation check was performed only on the actual Android or iOS device.
